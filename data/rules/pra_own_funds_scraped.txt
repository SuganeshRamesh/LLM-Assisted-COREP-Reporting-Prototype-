Latest updates

12 June 2023:

In the

PRA’s Future Approach to Policy (DP4/22

), the PRA announced it was launching a Banking Data Review (BDR). The review will look at what data it collects currently and what data the PRA needs now and in future.

The PRA will hold an Industry Consultative Forum on 5 July in hybrid format where we will share our phasing plan for the BDR and what we have planned for phase 1. The majority of the session will be allocated to hearing your views on our proposals and the impact these will have on your firm.

We have been coordinating this event through industry trade bodies, but if you have not been contacted through a trade body about this event you can get in touch directly at

BDRsecretariat@bankofengland.co.u

k to learn more and to register your attendance. Membership is open to heads of regulatory reporting or similar of all PRA regulated banks, building societies and designated investment firms.

Pillar 2 reporting instructions note

: As per

and PS17/21

, and finalised in

PS22/21

, the PRA has implemented the EBA Taxonomy 3.0 for firms to use from 1 January 2022. Firms should be using this taxonomy to meet the reporting requirements set out in the PS17/21. Any future changes to CRR reporting requirements will be subject to PRA public consultation process, as set out in FSMA.

The PRA has implemented EBA Taxonomy 2.10 for COR013 resolution reporting. Any future changes to BRRD reporting requirements will also be subject to PRA public consultation process.

Changes to validation rules are released periodically by the EBA. The Bank will implement any validation changes that relate to EBA Taxonomy 3.0 or previous taxonomy versions, for as long as these packages are used to meet reporting requirements.

Subsequent EBA taxonomies should only be implemented by firms if indicated during the PRA public consultation process for future reporting changes.

CP22_18@bankofengland.co.uk

.

12 October:

The PRA confirms that it is using its new individual risk methodologies as set out in

Statement of Policy ‘Pillar 2 liquidity’

in liquidity reviews. They are being applied at the current glide path factor.

We have previously stated our intention to set out proposals on the overall calibration of the liquidity framework in 2018. However, we have taken the decision to postpone finalisation of our proposals in order to conduct further analysis on the appropriate level of liquidity guidance. This includes the potential for some recognition in the Pillar 2 liquidity framework of the ability to draw on Bank of England liquidity facilities, where firms have access arrangements and appropriate collateral in place.

1 October:

Following

PS8/18 ‘Pillar 2: Updates to reporting requirements’

updated versions of

Statement of Policy ‘The PRA’s methodologies for setting Pillar 2 capital’

and

SS32/15 ‘Pillar 2, including instructions for completing data items FSA071 to FSA082, and PRA 111’

have come into effect. The Pillar 2 reporting schedule has also been updated, and is available above.

28 September:

Following the publication of the final PRA110 template and associated reporting instructions in

Policy Statement (PS) 2/18 ‘Pillar 2 liquidity’

, we have received a number of additional questions from firms regarding the template and reporting instructions. We have decided to publish answers to these questions (‘Q&As’) periodically, where questions received highlight a need to clarify the reporting instructions or rules. This document is version 1 of the PRA110 Q&As and covers responses on questions related to monetisation rows.

In addition, having considered feedback from firms, we have reviewed the currency reporting basis for the interim reporting period: firms should only submit on an all-currency basis and for US Dollars (USD), where USD is a material currency.

For more information see the

Interim reporting of PRA110 section

.

31 August:

To assist firms with their submission of
PRA110, we published a taxonomy release note alongside v3.1.1 of our XBRL
taxonomy, data point model (DPM) and taxonomy validations – see the Taxonomy
section below.

12 July

: Following our email to participating firms, we provided further information on the timing and basis of interim reporting for the introduction of PRA110.

By way of background, in

Policy Statement 2/18 ‘Pillar 2 liquidity’

the PRA introduced methodologies for the assessment of Pillar 2 liquidity risks and a cashflow mismatch risk (CFMR) framework. PRA110 is the new reporting template associated with the CFMR. On 17 January 2018, we updated this webpage to set out that, due to the postponement of the introduction of the PRA110 from 1 January 2019 to 1 July 2019, the interim reporting period would similarly be postponed until September 2018 at the earliest. Specific firms have been contacted to let them know of our intention to commence interim test reporting of the PRA110 and to request their firm’s participation. This update provides additional information on the timing and basis of interim reporting for participating firms.

Timelines and approach

Data submissions for the testing period will commence with end October 2018 data being collected in November 2018. During this time, the PRA110 should be submitted with existing FSA047 and FSA048 returns.

For firms currently reporting FSA047 and FSA048 on a monthly basis, please report the PRA110 as at the calendar month end. The submission is due within 15 business days of the reporting date.

For firms currently reporting FSA047 and FSA048 on a weekly basis, please report the PRA110 once per month, reporting data as at the last Friday of the month (in line with the FSA047 and FSA048 returns). The submission is due within 15 business days of the calendar month end.

Firms should submit the PRA110 on the following reporting basis:

submit on an all-currency basis and for the three single largest material currencies, or fewer if appropriate; and

submit PRA110 only for material UK subsidiaries (these will be selected in consultation with firms’ supervisors).

This will enable firms to:

assess their own internal processes for the production of the PRA110 returns;

assess that in-scope submissions pass the Gabriel blocking validation rules; and

demonstrate the accuracy of their PRA110 data ahead of FSA047 and FSA048 being switched off.

How to submit PRA110

To assist firms with their s

ubmission of PRA110, we published v3.0.0 of its XBRL taxonomy, data point model (DPM) and related technical artefacts on Friday 20 April 2018 (see below). We are aiming to have firms submit the PRA110 returns in the XBRL format via Gabriel.

How to contact us during the interim reporting period

We will collate questions from participating firms before issuing any updates to FAQ as and when common queries arise. This will also be supplemented by individual periodic responses from supervisors.

Please email questions to your supervisors and copy in

LiquidityPillar2ReportingProjectQueries@bankofengland.gsi.gov.uk

.

10 July:

We published an amended Branch Return Form. We will shortly consult on the change to the existing form. Until then, we would be grateful if firms are able to use the amended form from now onwards. See

Branch Return Form

below.

5 July:

We published v3.1.0 of the Bank of England Banking XBRL taxonomy, alongside related technical artefacts. This taxonomy is to be used for MREL reporting which follows

Policy Statement 11/18 ‘Resolution planning: MREL reporting’

, published on 13 June 2018. This will take effect from Tuesday 1 January 2019.

Please note: the BEEDS system will be used to collect MREL reporting data. The Bank will contact firms to request some basic details to grant access to the BEEDS portal. This will include a request for the nomination of a ‘principal user’ who will be the main contact for the firm with respect to BEEDS, register additional users, and submit returns. Firms should ensure they respond to the request by the deadline given, even where the principal user for MREL reporting is an existing user of BEEDS. Following this, further instructions on how to access BEEDS and an information guide will be sent directly to the nominated principal user.

13 June:

We published

Policy Statement 11/18 ‘Resolution planning: MREL reporting’

17 January:

In

CP13/17 ‘Pillar 2 Liquidity’

the PRA proposed to introduce a new liquidity reporting template (PRA110) to support the cash flow mismatch risk (CFMR) framework. Having considered responses, the PRA has decided to postpone the proposed introduction of PRA110 by 6 months, from 1 January 2019 to 1 July 2019. The interim reporting, proposed to start in March 2018, is also delayed by 6 months to at earliest September 2018. As proposed in CP13/17, the PRA intends to terminate the FSA047 and FSA048 returns at the same time the PRA110 is implemented. In case of any delay in the implementation of the PRA110, the PRA will delay the proposed termination of the FSA047 and FSA048 returns. The FSA047 and FSA048 termination remains linked to the implementation of the PRA110.

Working with the Financial Conduct Authority

We work with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to make sure the regulatory reporting processes for dual-regulated firms are efficient. We want to ensure that firms are only asked to submit data sets once and, to help achieve this, we will share data where it is appropriate to do so. We will also share data on firms that are not dual-regulated where necessary, to ensure that we each have a complete view of the market.

A memorandum of understanding between the FCA and the Bank of England (exercising its prudential regulation functions) sets out how we will work together.

Memorandum of Understanding between the FCA and the Bank of England (exercising its prudential regulation functions)

(pdf)

The Memorandum of Understanding obliges us to consult each other on changes to data/forms that are collected regularly, including the use of shared data definitions; and, the management of data systems to allow for efficient sharing.

Much regulatory data for PRA firms continues to be collected by the FCA. This includes reporting via the FCA’s

RegData

system, the submission of firms’ controllers and close links reports and the reporting of changes to firms’ standing data.

Statistical reporting obligations

have not changed.
